Welcome! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the **University of Texas at Austin** working with [Prof. Caitlin Casey](https://www.as.utexas.edu/~cmcasey/welcome.html) on high-redshift galaxy evolution.
In particular, I study massive galaxies and AGN in the **epoch of reionization**, a period of major phase change in the first billion years of the universe. 
I focus in particular on rare, bright objects discovered with major telescopes including *JWST* and ALMA, and I'm a member of the [COSMOS-Web](https://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu/) and [CEERS](https://ceers.github.io/) collaborations. 

I completed my Bachelors in Physics at Grinnell College in rural Iowa, surrounded by corn-fields and fueled by [small-town coffee](https://www.saintsrestcoffee.com/). 
While there I studied the evolution of the smallest galaxies in the local universe using hydrodynamic simulations as part of the [N-Body Shop](https://nbody.shop/) collaboration. 
I've also previously studied the color evolution of massive galaxies using the [SIMBA](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/) cosmological simulations.

This page will be a home for updates about my research projects, publications, and growth as a scientist.
